                    It stretched from present-day countries of Mali, Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, Chad,
                    Mauritania, and Burkina Faso. So who established this great empire?</p>

                <h2>Brief Description</h2>
                <p>Mansa Musa is well known for his wealth. He is said to be the richest person to have ever lived in
                    modern history. In the year 1324, the king made his Pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. He carried with him
                    gold, which he generously gave away. His generosity led to crippling economies, especially Egypt. It
                    took Egypt 12 years to recover!</p>
                <p>Additionally, the Mali empire was located strategically and controlled essential trading routes. As a
                    result, this made the Mali empire extremely wealthy. The empire grew to its highest heights under
                    Mansa Musa's reign.</p>

                    <p>Mansa Musa was the grandnephew of King Sundiata. He ruled the Mali kingdom from the year 1312 C.E
                        to 1337 C.E.</p>
                    <p>During this time, the kingdom of Mali was still relatively unknown outside of West Africa. All of
                        this changed in the year 1324 when Mansa Musa went on Pilgrimage.</p>
                    <p>During the reign of Mansa Musa, the empire of Mali accounted for almost half of the Old World's
                        gold, according to the British Museum.</p>

                    <p>Under his rule, the kingdom of Mali grew significantly. He annexed 24 cities, including Timbuktu.

                    wealth in the medieval world. Major trading centres that traded in gold and other goods were also in
